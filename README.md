# Simple broken Powershell script to automate load sorting

create a customers.txt file at the root of this directory with format
```
customername|misspelling1|cutstotmer|thereneeds|tobesix|columnsTotal
```
the only important bit is that there is six columns. fill the unneeded columns with junk like `alksdaopisdfo`. I haven't tested it with special characters, stick to alphanumeric only.
